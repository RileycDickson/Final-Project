# Simple Platformer Game

https://github.com/RileycDickson/Final-Project

This Program will open a pygame window where there will be a player and a basic Platformer level. You will then be able to move around using WASD or the arrow keys and collect coins. Once you collect all the coins you win.

Features:
Moving using WASD or Arrow keys.
Jumping with the Spacebar.
Picking up coins.
Counter that counts the coins you have collected.

Challenges:
I will need to learn how to make a playable character in Python.
I will need to learn how to put together a basic map with collisions.
I will need to learn how to get the character to pick up coins and add them to the counter.
I will need to learn how to position the images in the window to make a level.

Ideal Outcome:
I am able to make everything work and even add a few more features to the game to make it less basic.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
I am able to get most features working to the point where it is still a game.

Week 1 get pygame window set up and start importing objects like level terrain and pickups.

Week 2 Add player model and get collision working with ground.

Week 3 Add coins and counting meter and win condition.

Week 4 Final Touches/ Extra time if I fall behind.
